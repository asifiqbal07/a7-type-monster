                            This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object,
                            the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that
                            localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed.
                            It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a
                            document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).<br>
                            Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The
                            difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not
                            expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. 

                            A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions
                            are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the
                            tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new
                            session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session
                            cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own
                            sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied
                            to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage
                            objects.

                            An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It is a new feature introduced in
                            ES6 that is a
                            more concise syntax for writing function expressions. Both regular JavaScript functions and
                            arrow functions
                            work in a similar manner but there are some differences between them. Let's see the
                            differences below: -

                            Function .map() is a manipulative function that can modify each element’s content in an
                            array that it is called on. This function returns a new array with modified values, the
                            array that it is called on will stay still. <br>
                            Function .forEach() is another form of just a plain for loop that can be used to iterate
                            through array items. This case of a function is used for more complex arrays, for example,
                            an array of objects with a lot of entries than just an array of integers. <br>
                            Function .filter() is a search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the
                            assigned condition. You can search by simple terms, for example, that element is equal to a
                            certain integer, or by more advanced terms, for example, searching for an object with
                            certain property that is equal to something. <br>
                            Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small
                            detail — this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one
                            result, the function will return the first that has matched.
